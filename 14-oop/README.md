# What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.
It utilizes several techniques from previously established paradigms, including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The main idea behind OOP is to bind together the
data and the functions that operate on the data into a single unit called an object. This allows for better organization of code and makes it easier to manage and maintain.

### OOP Concepts
1. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.
2. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that contains both data and functions that operate on the data.
3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is done to prevent accidental modification of data and to hide the internal implementation details of the object from the outside world.
4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. It allows for the creation of a simplified model of a complex system, making it easier to understand and use.
5. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
6. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows for the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects, making it easier to write flexible and reusable code.


### Why OOP?
- **Modularity & Organization** - Organize code into manageable objects/classes
- **Reusability** - Reuse classes across projects, reduce code duplication
- **Maintainability** - Easy to update and debug without affecting other parts
- **Scalability** - Build large, complex applications efficiently
- **Real-World Modeling** - Objects mirror real-world entities
- **Encapsulation** - Hide complexity, control data access
- **Inheritance** - Share common functionality through class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism** - Write flexible code for multiple object types
- **Easier Teamwork** - Clear boundaries for collaborative development
- **Industry Standard** - Essential for modern programming languages and frameworks
